Web-based Blood Donation Management System is a management system website that

enables individuals who want to donate blood to help the ones who need it. 

It also enables hospitals to record and store the data for people who want to donate blood,

and it also provides a centralized blood bank database. 

The system is developed by using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL as a database system to manage and store the data. 

The system targets three types of users: the individuals who want to donate blood, the recipients who need the donated blood, 

and the hospitals that work as an intermediary to manage the blood donation and delivery. 

The main objectives for developing the website is to educate the community on the benefits of blood donation, 

develop a Web-Based Blood Bank System to manage the records of donors and recipients, 

and encourage voluntary blood donation, easily accessing any information about blood type and 

the distribution of the blood in various hospitals.
